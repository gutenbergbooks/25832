<h3>XVI.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Midnight's meridian is supposed to mark</p>
<p class="i0">The bound twixt toil and slumber. Light and dark</p>
<p class="i2">Mete out the lives of mortals</p>
<p class="i0">In happy alternation," said my guide.</p>
<p class="i0">"Six hours must fleet ere Phoebus shall set wide</p>
<p class="i2">His glowing orient portals.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"The last loud halloo at the tavern-door</p>
<p class="i0">long since has driven the reckless and the poor</p>
<p class="i2">From misery's only haven</p>
<p class="i0">Forth on the chilling night. 'All out! All out!'</p>
<p class="i0">Less sad would fall on bibulous' souls, no doubt,</p>
<p class="i2">The refrain of the Raven.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"London lies shuttered close. Law's measured beat</p>
<p class="i0">Falls echoing down the shadow-chequered street;</p>
<p class="i2">A distant cab-wheel clatters;</p>
<p class="i0">The wastrel's drunken cry, the waif's low moan,</p>
<p class="i0">Reach not the ear of tired Philistia, prone,</p>
<p class="i2">Dreaming of other matters."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The Shadow's slow subacid speech, I knew,</p>
<p class="i0">Foreboded more than mirth. Downward we drew,</p>
<p class="i2">Silent, and all un-noted,</p>
<p class="i0">O'er sleeping Shopdom. Sleeping? Closer quest</p>
<p class="i0">Might prove it one vast Valley of Unrest</p>
<p class="i2">O'er which we mutely floated.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Post-midnight peace," I said, "must fall like balm,</p>
<p class="i0">After the long day's turmoil, on this calm,</p>
<p class="i2">Close-clustering, lamp-lit city,"</p>
<p class="i0">"Peace?" sighed the Shadow. "She of the white dove</p>
<p class="i0">Is not less partial in her gifts than Love,</p>
<p class="i2">Or Wealth, or Worldly Pity.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"See yon close-shuttered shop! Peace broodeth there,</p>
<p class="i0">You deem perchance; but look within. A lair</p>
<p class="i2">Of midnight smugglers, stirring</p>
<p class="i0">At the sea's signal, scarce seems more agog.</p>
<p class="i0">And yet each toiler's heart lies like a log,</p>
<p class="i2">Sleep each tired eye is blurring.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Feet scuttle, fingers fleet, pens work apace;</p>
<p class="i0">A whipt-up zeal marks every pallid face;</p>
<p class="i2">One voice austere, sonorous,</p>
<p class="i0">Chides, threatens, sometimes curses. How they flush,</p>
<p class="i0">Its victims silent, tame! That voice would hush</p>
<p class="i2">A seraph-choir in chorus.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Strident, sardonic, stern; the harrying sound</p>
<p class="i0">Lashes them like a flail the long hours round,</p>
<p class="i2">Till to strained nerves 'twere sweeter</p>
<p class="i0">To silence it with one fierce passionate grip,</p>
<p class="i0">Than into some bland Lotos Land to slip,</p>
<p class="i2">And moon out life to metre.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"From early morn till midnight these poor slaves</p>
<p class="i0">Have 'served the public;' now, when nature craves</p>
<p class="i2">Rest from the strain and scurry</p>
<p class="i0">Of Shopdom's servitude, they still must wake</p>
<p class="i0">Some weary hours, though hands with fever shake</p>
<p class="i2">And nerves are racked with worry.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Though the great streets are still, the shutters up,</p>
<p class="i0">Gas flares within, and ere they sleep or sup</p>
<p class="i2">These serfs of Competition</p>
<p class="i0">Must clean, and sort and sum. There's much to do</p>
<p class="i0">Behind those scenes set fair to public view</p>
<p class="i2">By hucksters of position.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"The shop-assistant's Sabbath has begun!</p>
<p class="i0">His sixteen hours long Saturday has run</p>
<p class="i2">Its wearing course and weary.</p>
<p class="i0">The last light's out, and many an aching head</p>
<p class="i0">At last, at last, seeks in a lonely bed</p>
<p class="i2">A dreamland dim and dreary.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"In roseate visions shall racked souls rejoice</p>
<p class="i0">Haunted by echoes of that harrying voice?</p>
<p class="i2">Nay, friend, uncounted numbers</p>
<p class="i0">Of victims to commercial strain and stress,</p>
<p class="i0">Seek nought more sweet than dull forgetfulness</p>
<p class="i2">In the short night's scant slumbers."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Too sombre Spirit, hath the opening year</p>
<p class="i0">No scenes of gayer hope and gentler cheer?</p>
<p class="i2">Is all beneath night's curtain</p>
<p class="i0">In this vast city void of promise glad?</p>
<p class="i0">Are all the guests of midnight spectres sad,</p>
<p class="i2">And suffering and uncertain?"</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">So I addressed the Shadow. "Friend," he smiled.</p>
<p class="i0">"'Twas 'lurid London' that you wished 'untiled.'</p>
<p class="i2">Most secret things are sinister.</p>
<p class="i0">Innocent mirth needs no Ithuriel spear</p>
<p class="i0">To make its inner entity appear.</p>
<p class="i2">Still, to your mood I'll minister.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Not long-drawn Labour only breaks the rest</p>
<p class="i0">Of London's night. Society in quest</p>
<p class="i2">Of Gold's sole rival, Pleasure,</p>
<p class="i0">Makes little of the bounds of dark and day.</p>
<p class="i0">Night's hours lead on a dance as glad and gay</p>
<p class="i2">As the old Horaes' measure.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Look!" Such a burst of laughter shook the room</p>
<p class="i0">As might dispel a desert anchorite's gloom.</p>
<p class="i2">Flushed faces keen and clever</p>
<p class="i0">Contorted wildly; such mirth-moving shape</p>
<p class="i0">Was taken by that genial histrion's jape</p>
<p class="i2">As mobs are mute at never.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">A long soft-lighted room, the muffled beat</p>
<p class="i0">On carpets soft of watchful waiters' feet</p>
<p class="i2">In deft attendance gliding;</p>
<p class="i0">A table spread with toothsome morsels, fit</p>
<p class="i0">For the night-feast of genius, wealth and wit,</p>
<p class="i2">Of a skilled <i>chef's</i> providing.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Goodfellowship, <i>bonnes bouches</i>, right pleasant tales</p>
<p class="i0">Of <i>bonnes fortunes!</i> Here a quaint cynic rails,</p>
<p class="i2">There an enthusiast gushes.</p>
<p class="i0">Gay talk flows on, not in a rolling stream,</p>
<p class="i0">But with the brooklet's intermittent gleam</p>
<p class="i2">And brisk irradiant rushes.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Side-lights from all Society shift here</p>
<p class="i0">Reflected in keen <i>mot</i> and jocund jeer,</p>
<p class="i2">Wild jest, and waggish whimsey.</p>
<p class="i0">Stagedom disrobed and Statecraft in undress,</p>
<p class="i0">Stars of the Art-world, pillars of the Press,</p>
<p class="i2">Sage solid, <i>fl&acirc;neur</i> flimsy,</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">All cross and counter here; they lounge and sup:</p>
<p class="i0">The fragrant smoke-cloud and the foaming cup</p>
<p class="i2">Tickle their eager senses.</p>
<p class="i0">What care these for the clock, whilst banter flows</p>
<p class="i0">And dainty "snacks" and toothsome herring-roes</p>
<p class="i2">The distant cook dispenses?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"How different these," my calm companion said,</p>
<p class="i0">"From the crowd yonder! These yearn not for bed</p>
<p class="i2">As rest from leaden labour.</p>
<p class="i0">The night may be far spent, the Sabbath dawns,</p>
<p class="i0">But here no dull brain-palsied drowser yawns</p>
<p class="i2">At his half-nodding neighbour.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"With wit, and wealth, and wine, the hours of night</p>
<p class="i0">In sombre Babylon may dispense delight.</p>
<p class="i2">These revellers, slumber-scorning,</p>
<p class="i0">Radiant and well-arrayed, will stop, and stop,</p>
<p class="i0">Till waiters drowse. But then, yon slaves of Shop</p>
<p class="i2">Must meet a different morning."</p>

<h2>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">An Unsatisfactory Christmas Present.</span>&mdash;We can well understand and
sympathise with you in your disappointment on discovering that you had
been deceived as to the amount of intelligence possessed by the Learned
Pig that you had been induced to purchase as a Christmas present for
your invalid Grandfather. It must have been very annoying, after having
imagined that you had provided your aged relative with a nice long
winter's evening amusement resulting from the creature's advertised
powers of telling fortunes and spelling sentences with a pack of
ordinary playing cards, to receive a letter from the housekeeper
bitterly complaining of its performance, which seems merely to have
consisted of eating all the tea-cake, biting a housemaid, getting
between your Grandfather's legs and upsetting him in his armchair, and,
finally, when pursued, trying to obtain refuge in the grand piano. You
cannot be surprised after this experience, that it has been intimated to
you that if you do not take the creature yourself away at once, it will
be forthwith handed over to the first policeman that passes. Yes, spite
the pig's reputed intellectual gifts, we would advise you to close with
the pork-butcher's offer you mention. When the creature has been cut up,
send your Grandfather some of the sausages. This may possibly appease
the old gentleman, and serve to allay the irritation that your
unfortunate Christmas gift appears to have occasioned.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The North Walls</span>.&mdash;The Sporting Correspondent of the <i>Sunday Times</i> tells
us that Colonel <span class="sc">North</span> is "having a new ball-room"&mdash;(he wouldn't have an
old one built, would he? But no matter)&mdash;"the walls of which are
composed of onyx." Of course, a Billionaire pays all the workmen
punctually and regularly; therefore, "Owe-nix" walls are an appropriate
memorial. <i>Si monumentum qu&aelig;ris, circumspice.</i></p>

<h2>DARES AND ENTELLUS.</h2>

<p>(<i>New Non-Virgilian Version told by Punchius to the Shade of Sayerius in
the Elysian Fields, With Intercalary Observations by the Illustrious
ex-Pugilist.</i>)</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 60%;">
<a href="images/014.png">
<img src="images/014.png" width="100%" alt="&quot;What do you think of that, Tom?&quot;" title="DARES AND ENTELLUS." /></a>
<br />
<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> "What do you think of that, Tom?"</p>
<p><i>Shade of Sayers.</i> "<span class="sc">Think</span>!" (<i>Disgusted.</i>) "<span class="sc">Why, I think the sooner the
P. R.'s put down, the better</span>!"</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="sc">Then</span> bulky <span class="sc">Dares</span> in the ring appears,<br />
Chucking his "castor" in 'midst husky cheers.<br />
<span class="sc">Dares</span>, the so-called "Champion" of his land,<br />
Who met the great <span class="sc">Kilrainus</span> hand to hand,<br />
And at the Pelicanus strove&mdash;in vain&mdash;<br />
The Ethiopian's onset to sustain.<br />
Such <span class="sc">Dares</span> was, and such he strode along,<br />
And drew hoarse homage from the howling throng.<br />
His brawny breast and bulky arms he shows,}<br />
His lifted fists around his head he throws,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
Huge caveats to the inadvertent nose.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
But <span class="sc">Dares</span>, who, although a sinewy brute,<br />
Had not of late increased his old repute,<br />
Looked scarce like one prepared for gain or loss,<br />
And scornful of the surreptitious "cross;"<br />
Rather the kind of cove who tackled fair<br />
Would think more of the "corner" than "the square."<br />
(<i>"Ah! bust him, yes!"</i> <span class="sc">Sayerius</span> <i>here put in,<br />
"He meant to tie or wrangle, not to win.<br />
I'd like to&mdash;well, all right, I will not say:<br />
But 'twasn't so at Farnborough in my day."</i>)<br />
Next stout <span class="sc">Entellus</span> for the strife prepares,<br />
Strips off his ulster, and his body bares,<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Composed of mighty bone and brawn he stands.<br />
A six-foot straight, "fine fellow of his hands."<br />
<span class="sc">Entellus</span>, Champion of the Austral realm,<br />
Whose sight fat <span class="sc">Dares</span> seemed to overwhelm.<br />
(<i>"Yah!" cried</i> <span class="sc">Sayerius</span>, "<i>brave</i> <span class="sc">Heenanus</span> <i>stood<br />
Well over me; yes, and his grit was good.<br />
But did I funk the Big 'Un from the fust?<br />
No, nor when nine times I had bit the dust!"</i>)<br />
They both attentive stand with eyes intent,<br />
Their arms well up, their bodies backward bent.<br />
One on his clamorous "Corner" most relies;<br />
The other on his sinews and his size.<br />
Unequal in success, they ward, they strike,<br />
Their styles are different, but their aims alike.<br />
Big blows are dealt; stout <span class="sc">Dares</span> hops around,<br />
His pulpy sides the rattling thumps resound.<br />
(<i>"He always was a fleshy 'un, yer know,"<br />
Said brave</i> <span class="sc">Sayerius</span>. "<i>But on yer go!"</i>)<br />
Steady and straight <span class="sc">Entellus</span> stands his ground,<br />
Although already rowdy rows abound.<br />
His hand and watchful eyes keep even pace,<br />
While <span class="sc">Dares</span> traverses and shifts his place,<br />
And, like a cornered rat in a big pit,<br />
Keeps off, and doesn't like the job a bit.<br />
("<i>No, that I'll bet</i>!," <i>the brave</i> <span class="sc">Sayerius</span> <i>said</i>.<br />
<i>"Wish I'd been there to punch his bloomin' 'ed!"</i>)<br />
More on his feet than fists the cur relies,<br />
And on that crowded "Corner" keeps his eyes.<br />
With straightening shots <span class="sc">Entellus</span> threats the foe,}<br />
But <span class="sc">Dares</span> dodges the descending blow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />
And back into his Corner's prompt to go.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />
Where bludgeon, knuckleduster, knotted sticks,<br />
Foul sickening blows and cruel coward kicks<br />
Are in his interest on <span class="sc">Entellus</span> rained<br />
At every point that plucky boxer gained.<br />
(<i>"Oh!" groaned</i> <span class="sc">Sayerius</span>. "<i>And this sort of thing</i><br />
<i>Wos let go on, with gents around the Ring!"</i>)<br />
In vain <span class="sc">Entellus</span> gave sly <span class="sc">Dares</span> snuff;<br />
<span class="sc">Dares</span> already felt he'd had enough;<br />
But twenty ruffians, thralls of bets and "booze,"<br />
Had sworn could he not win he should not lose.<br />
<span class="sc">Dares</span>, you see, was "Champion" of his land,<br />
And these were "Trojans all" you'll understand.<br />
(<i>"Champion be blowed!"</i> <span class="sc">Sayerius</span> <i>said</i>. "<i>Wus luck,<br />
They wasn't Trojans. This is British pluck!</i>")<br />
Then from the Corner fiendish howls arise,<br />
And oaths and execrations rend the skies.<br />
<span class="sc">Entellus</span> stoutly to the fight returned.<br />
Kicked, punched and mauled, his eyes with fury burned,<br />
Disdain and conscious courage fired his breast,<br />
And with redoubled force his foe he pressed,<br />
Laid on with either hand like anything,<br />
And headlong drove his rival round the Ring;<br />
Nor stops nor stays, nor rest, nor breath allows.<br />
Thereon the Corner raised redoubled rows,<br />
Yelled false alarms of "Rescue!" heaved half-bricks,<br />
And murderous missiles and unmanly kicks<br />
Poured on <span class="sc">Entellus</span>, whilst fat <span class="sc">Dares</span> slunk<br />
Between his bullies, like a shabby skunk.<br />
(<i>"Bah!" growled</i> <span class="sc">Sayerius</span>. "<i>Fancy</i> <span class="sc">Cribbs</span> <i>or</i> <span class="sc">Gullies</span><br />
<i>Backing down under guard of blackguard bullies!"</i>)<br />
But now the Ref., who saw the row increase,<br />
Declared a "draw," and bade the combat cease.<br />
(<i>"A draw?"</i> <span class="sc">Sayerius</span> <i>shouted</i>. "<i>Wos he drunk?<br />
Or had he, like the rest, a fit of funk?"</i>)<br />
"This," <span class="sc">Punchius</span> said, "ended the precious game,<br />
In which all, save <span class="sc">Entellus</span>, suffered shame.<br />
<span class="sc">Sayerius</span> mine, I trust you take delight<br />
In this description of a Champion Fight!"<br />
<br />
"A <i>Fight</i>," <span class="sc">Sayerius</span> shouted. "Oh, get out!<br />
It was a 'barney.' If this ruffian rout<br />
Of cheats and 'bashers' now surround the Ring,<br />
You'd better stop it as a shameful thing.<br />
In <span class="sc">Jackson's</span> time, and even in my day,<br />
It did want courage, and did mean fair play&mdash;<br />
Most times, at least. But don't mix up <i>this</i> muck<br />
With tales of rough-and-tumble British pluck.<br />
I'd like to shake <span class="sc">Entellus</span> by the hand,<br />
And give that <span class="sc">Dares</span>&mdash;wot he'd understand<br />
Better, you bet, than being fair or "game,"<br />
Or trying to keep up the Old Country's name!<br />
But anyhow, if Boxing's sunk so low<br />
As <i>this</i>, why, hang it, <span class="sc">Punchius</span>, <i>let it go!</i>"<br />
Said <i>Punch</i>, as from the Elysian Fields he strode,<br />
"If you're not right, <span class="sc">Sayerius</span> mine, I'm blowed!"<br /></p>

write down "holiday tasks." It is such a beastly shame that fellows home
for "the Yule-Tide Vacation" (as our Head Master calls it), should have
to be stewing away at all sorts of beastly things. No&mdash;if we are to do
anything in the working line, let us have a paper like the subjoined,
which, at any rate, will test our knowledge of what we have been doing
during the holidays. You will see I have added the answers in the manner
I think they should be given to secure full marks. Believe me, dear <i>Mr.
Punch</i>,</p>

<p class="author">Yours sincerely,&nbsp;  <span class="sc">Smith Minimus</span>.
</p>

<p>1. Give a short account of your Christmas dinner, distinguishing between
the sustenance for the body, and the food for the mind.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Whole affair stunning. Turkey and mince-pies first-rate.
Champagne might have been drier&mdash;but, tol lol! Uncle <span class="sc">Bob</span> rather prosy,
but his girls capital fun. Tips satisfactory.</p>

<p>2. What do you know of (1) the Pantomime at the Crystal Palace, (2) the
World's Fair at the Agricultural Hall, and (3) the Panorama of Waterloo
at Ashley Place?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> (1.) <i>Aladdin</i> is the subject of the Palace Pantomime, which
is not half bad. Mr. <span class="sc">Dauban</span>, as usual, capital, and the dresses quite
Drury Lane form. Scenery, too, (especially Willow-pattern Plate) up to
the mark, if not more so. (2.) World's Fair, at Agricultural Hall,
rather mixed. Excellent menagerie&mdash;good old <span class="sc">Blondin</span>&mdash;but side-shows
second-rate. Shakspearian Pantaloon in one of the latter seemed to be
enjoying Christmas in the old-fashioned manner. (3.) Panorama of
Waterloo, not only patriotic, but artistic. Regular good set-to between
the Highlanders and French Cuirassiers. Skull in the Relics
Department&mdash;pretty ornament for the Annual Banquet at the Surgeons'
Hall.</p>

<p>3. Given a traveller from Charing Cross to St. Clement's Danes, describe
the places of interest he would pass during the journey.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> I think the best way of flooring this question is to say what
I should do if I made the voyage. Take a cup of chocolate at A&euml;rated
Bread Company,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> with two pennyworth of butter and cake; then to the
Lowther Arcade, to get some toys for the young 'uns. Next to <span class="sc">Gatti's</span>
Restaurant for Lunch. Being a good day for <i>Matin&eacute;es</i>, look in at
<span class="sc">Terry's</span> for First Act of <i>Sweet Lavender</i>, then to the Op&eacute;ra Comique for
Second Act of <i>Real Little Lord Fauntleroy</i>; lastly, wind up with a bit
of <i>Our Flat</i> at the Strand. Dine quietly at the Gaiety before
seeing the <i>Dead Heart</i> at the Lyceum, which will produce an appetite,
to be appeased only at <span class="sc">Rule's</span>, where you can take a light supper&mdash;then
to bed.</p>

<p>4. Do you think that the Head Master of your school would derive any
benefit from a closer association with the Metropolis? If you do, give
your reason for such an opinion.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> I decidedly think old <span class="sc">Swishtale</span> would be better for a week
(under supervision) in London. Might take him to the Empire, the Pav.,
and to see <i>Ruy Blas, or the Blas&eacute; Rou&eacute;</i>. If it did him no other good,
it would afford him a topic for conversation at lesson time.</p>

<p><i>Six Solicitors' Representatives</i> (<i>speaking together</i>). Won't take a
minute in&mdash;only an order to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chief Clerk.</i> One at a time, Gentlemen! Who has the conduct of this
matter?</p>

<p><i>First Solicitor's Representative.</i> I have, Sir. It's an order to sell
some freehold land. We have half a dozen valuations, and we want you to
decide the conditions of sale.</p>

<p><i>Chief Clerk.</i> Hand in the documents, and let the matter be submitted to
the conveyancing counsel for a draft. Adjourned for a week. Next,
please! <span class="sc">Jones</span> <i>versus</i> <span class="sc">Robinson</span>!</p>

<p><i>Second Solicitor's Representative</i> (<i>forcing his way to the front</i>). This
suit has been going on for six years, and we have got to second further
consideration. By the recent statute, Sir, you now have to tax the
costs.</p>

<p><i>Chief Clerk.</i> Very well; hand them in, and when I have looked through
them I will give you an appointment to proceed. Next, please! <span class="sc">Snooks</span>
<i>versus</i> <span class="sc">Tompkins</span>!</p>

<p><i>Third Solicitor's Representative.</i> Settlement of certificate. There are
eighteen parties to this suit, and we have seventeen present&mdash;the
eighteenth would be here, but I fancy the gentleman in charge of the
matter has the influenza, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chief Clerk</i> (<i>relieved</i>). Oh, very well, then; as we can't proceed
behind his back, we must adjourn it. <span class="sc">Shrimp</span> <i>versus</i> <span class="sc">Lambkin</span>!</p>

<p><i>Fourth Solicitor's Representative</i> (<i>promptly</i>). Rather a hard case, Sir.
One of the beneficiaries, who presumably is entitled to the interest on
&pound;20,000 for six years, is in urgent need of five pounds, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chief Clerk</i> (<i>looking at summons</i>). Are you opposed?</p>

<p><i>Fifth Solicitor's Representative</i>. Certainly, Sir; although my client
instructs me to say that he too considers it a hard case, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chief Clerk</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). I have no power, then, to make an order;
but, of course, if you like, I will put it in the Judges' list.
Application refused. <span class="sc">Bunkum</span> <i>versus</i> <span class="sc">Tinsel</span>!</p>

<p><i>Sixth Solicitor's Representative.</i> Remuneration of Receiver, Sir. You
have the papers.</p>

<p><i>Chief Clerk</i> (<i>glancing at documents</i>). I think the Receiver had some
special trouble in the matter.</p>

<p><i>Sixth Solicitor's Representative.</i> Yes, Sir. I appear for him, and he
tells me he has employed six clerks.</p>

<p><i>Chief Clerk.</i> Quite so&mdash;commission at seven per cent. <span class="sc">Peace</span> <i>versus</i>
<span class="sc">Goodwill</span>!</p>

<p><i>Seventh Solicitor's Representative.</i> Proceed with accounts. We object
to item 29&mdash;grave-stone to testator. Will said that the funeral was to
be of the simplest character, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chief Clerk.</i> I see. Disallowed. What other items are objected to?</p>

<p><i>Seventh Solicitor's Representative.</i> Nos. 33, 44, 87, 136, 150 to 506
inclusive: but, Sir, as some of these may take some time, and we are not
quite prepared&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chief Clerk.</i> Very well. Adjourned for three months. <span class="sc">Wyld</span> <i>versus</i>
<span class="sc">Shepherd</span> and Others!</p>

<p><i>Eighth Solicitor's Representative.</i> We wish to suspend the Manager of
the Restaurant in this matter. It is alleged that he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chief Clerk</i> (<i>who has glanced at the papers).</i> I shall not deal myself
with this matter, but put it in the Judges' list. And now, Gentlemen, as
I have to attend his Lordship in his own Chambers, I am afraid the other
matters must be adjourned to another occasion.</p>

<div class="direction">[<i>Exit into inner Apartment hurriedly</i>.</div>

<h2>ROBERT ON GOOD OLD KRISMUS.</h2>

<p>Of course I don't kno how jolly Old Krismus affecks other peepel, but I
do kno how it affecks me, and that is, that I allus feels pertickler
kind to pore ragged littel children, such as we sees in sum of our
back-streets and sitch places, and eweryboddy can therefore understand
without werry much trubble how werry pleased I was at what append the
other day, and how jolly prowd I was at being alloud to have my little
share in it.</p>

<p>I offishyated the other day at a werry werry nice party of about twenty,
at one of our best Tavverns, and they was about as nice and brite and
jowial a set of Gents as I have had the honner of waiting on for sum
time parst. They larfed and they chatted away as I likes to see 'em, cos
I nos from my long experience that them's the sort of Gents as is allus
werry libberal to the pore Waiters. Well, one of the werry britest and
wittyest of 'em all, jest about the time as the sperrits is the highest,
wiz., about a hower after dinner, when the wine is a having its werry
best effect, pulls a paper out of his pocket that was ruled all over,
and had a lot of names on it, and he says, says he, with his werry
britest smile, "We've all had a jolly nice dinner, and plenty of good
honnest fun, and I now want you all to join me in a reel good lark;" and
they all looks at him quite hegerly. Then he says, "If you will every
one of you give me a shilling, I will let you have a chance in my
lottery, where they is all prizes and no blanks, and the prizes will
give as much plezzur and appyness," says he, "as the jolly good dinner
we has all just had."</p>

<p>So they all larfed at the funny idear, and they past the paper round,
and ewery one on 'em sined his name and cashed up a shilling.</p>

<p>"I now garrantees," I think he sed, "that for ewery shilling you have
given me no less than twenty-four pore little children shall have a good
dinner; and so, as there is jest twenty of us, we shall have purwided a
good dinner for no less than fore hunderd and hayty pore little hungry
children!"</p>

<p>I was that estonished at this wunderfull rewelashun that I was struck
dum for a minnet, while the jolly party rapped the table and cried,
"Bravo!" But I soon pulled myself together, and, going up quietly behind
the kind-arted Gent, I says, in a whisper, "Please, Sir, will you kindly
let me be a subscriber?" And he did, and I paid my shilling, and sined
my name, amid the cheers of the cumpny, and then retired, as prowd as a
Alderman. But what a fact for an Hed Waiter to ponder hover! A dinner
for a hapenny! and the dinner as this jolly party had bin a eating cost,
I dessay, quite thirty shillings a head, which I makes out to be, not
being a werry grand skoller, about enuff for some seven hunderd pore
children's dinners! I leaves to stronger heds than mine to calkerlate
how many pore children the bill for the hole twenty wood have paid for;
<span class="sc">Brown</span> says ewer so many thousands; but <span class="sc">Brown</span> does always xagerate so.</p>

<h2>"HER MAJESTY'S OPPOSITION."</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Augustus Druriolanus Imperator</span>, of course, represents "the Government,"
and Messrs. <span class="sc">H. J. Leslie</span> and <span class="sc">Harris (Charles</span> of that ilk) are "Her
Majesty's Opposition," who are to be congratulated on their Pantomime of
<i>Cinderella</i> at Her Majesty's Theatre. Having purchased the book,&mdash;which
must be classed among the "good books" of the season,&mdash;I can say
decidedly that there is a considerable, though not a material,
difference between the Pantomime <i>Cinderella</i> "as she is wrote" by the
two pretty men "Messrs. <span class="sc">Richard</span> and <span class="sc">Henry</span>,"&mdash;whose surnames, I am
informed, are synonymous with those of a great English theologian and a
still greater English astronomer,&mdash;and "the Pantomime <i>Cinderella</i>" as
she is now performed at Her Majesty's. "Cut and run" must ever be the
motto of the Playright's and the theatrical Manager's action; but what
astonished me, before I consulted the book, was the omission on the
stage of the striking dramatic climax,&mdash;especially striking, because a
clock is involved in it,&mdash;of <i>Cinderella's</i> story.</p>




<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">

<br /><br /><p> Portrait of Cinderella "Palmer qu&aelig; meruit." A Minnie-ture.</p>
</div>



<p>Could I believe my eyes, when, after a magnificent ball-room scene,
where the colours are grouped with consummate skill and taste, I saw the
handsome prince Miss <span class="sc">Robina</span> <i>rempla&ccedil;ante</i> of Miss <span class="sc">Violet Cameron</span>, lead
to her place in the centre of that glittering throng the <i>petite et
pétillante Cinderella</i> in her Court dress, wearing her little glass
slippers (very little slippers, and very little glass), and then,
nothing happened, except that the next Scene descended, and hid them
from view.</p>

<p>But, Heavens! had the Clock in the Palace Yard stopped? Had its works
got out of order? Had it followed the example of the Dock and Gasmen,
and "struck," by refusing to strike? Ah! "Inventor and Producer," Ah!
Mr. <span class="sc">H. J. Leslie</span>, "Ah!" to everyone who had a hand in this sacrilege;
"Ah!" on behalf of Messrs. <span class="sc">Richard</span> and <span class="sc">Henry</span>, who could not have yielded
this point except under a strong protest,&mdash;please restore this. We would
all of us from eight years old (permitted by home licence to go to
theatres at night during Christmas holidays), and up to over fifty
(compelled to go to look after the others, and delighted to do so)&mdash;we
would all of us rather hear the clock strike twelve, see <i>Cinderella</i> in
rags, running for bare life, see the Prince in despair at the flight of
his partner, on whose card his name was down for sixteen more valses and
galops, than witness a black-and-white dance, with fans, pretty in
itself, and set to very pretty Solomonesque music, but meaningless as
regards plot.</p>

<p>Here is the stage-direction&mdash;"<i>At the end of song</i>"&mdash;which should have
been a national song, by Mr. <span class="sc">Clement Scott</span>, but wasn't&mdash;in fact, there
was no song at all, as well as I can remember, though I rather think the
crowd were always more or less singing a chorus,&mdash;"<i>clock strikes</i>." If
it did, I didn't hear it. If it did, why didn't the characters behave as
sich, and on <i>Cinderella's</i> saying what the authors have written, and
which I am positive I didn't hear,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i9">"What shall I do? the hour has struck at last!</p>
<p class="i9">I hope to goodness that that clock's too fast!"</p>

<center><span class="sc">"The Two Macs."</span></center>
</div>

<p>why didn't they execute a "<i>Hurried Gallop</i>," and why wasn't the
stage-direction, "<i>The Ball breaks up</i>,"&mdash;the printer prefers "breakes
up,"&mdash;"<i>in wild confusion</i>" carried out? No one knows better than this
present scribe what changes are necessitated at the last moment, and
after the book is published. But an alteration which omits the point of
the story is scarcely an improvement. It does not affect me that the
demon <i>Scroogins</i> was reduced comparatively to a dummy, for poor Mr.
<span class="sc">Shiel Barry</span> was suffering from dreadful hoarseness, and could hardly
speak, much less sing. There were originally too many plums in the
pudding. The knock-about scene by two <span class="sc">Armstrongs</span>, in imitation of our
old friends the Two MACS, very ingeniously introduced as <i>Jeames the
First</i> and <i>Jeames the Second</i>, Royal Footmen, is immensely funny.
<i>Cinderella's</i> j&ouml;delling lullaby is pretty. All the music is bright and
lively, and I fancy that though there are the names of four or five
Composers to the bill, Conductor <span class="sc">Solomon</span>,&mdash;who keeps them all going, and
sticks to his beat with the tenacity of a policeman,&mdash;has done the major
part of it, and the minor too. Bravo, Mr. <span class="sc">Edward Solomon</span>! "What's a hat
without a head?" and what's a Norchestra without a <span class="sc">Ned</span>? Mr. <span class="sc">Alfred
Cellier</span> is responsible for a charming minuet.</p>

<p>One more question&mdash;Where were "the Lyrics by Mr. <span class="sc">Clement Scott</span>?" Is Mr.
<span class="sc">Leslie</span> satisfied with one Lyric in Shaftesbury Avenue? And is he keeping
back Mr. <span class="sc">Scott's</span> for his next Opera? Perhaps though, as Miss <span class="sc">Violet
Cameron</span> now appears as the Prince, the lyrics are sweetly sung, which is
an inducement to revisit <i>Cinderella chez elle</i>.</p>

<p>The Transformation Scene is very effective. Will the Public ever regain
their taste for the short Pantomime, with one Big Show in it, and an
hour's Harlequinade.</p>

<h2>A JAPANESE BELLE.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This tiny Japanese lady, whom you left, as you thought, on the lid
of the glove-box at home."&mdash;<i>Sir Edwin Arnold, in Daily Telegraph.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Edwin Arnold</span>, Knight and Poet, vividly descriptive man,<br />
I'm in love, and you must know it, with your <i>belle</i> in far Japan.</p>

<p>Her <i>kimono</i> looks so telling with sleeve swaying in the wind,<br />
And the amber <i>obi</i> swelling into satin bows behind.</p>

<p>Though her charming little nose is, you confess, a trifle flat,<br />
When the lips are red as roses, who would stop to think of that?</p>

<p>Sunny smiles so sweet and simple, scornful cynic soul might win,<br />
While a most bewitching dimple guards the fascinating chin.</p>

<p>Teeth the purest pearl outshining, shell-pink nails, and she will wear<br />
Just one red camellia twining in her ebon wealth of hair.</p>

<p>Jet looks grey beside her tresses blacker than the murk midnight,<br />
While the little hand that presses each coquettish curl shines white.</p>

<p>She is quite an <i>avis rara</i>, but her lips for me were dumb,<br />
Though she murmured, "<i>Sayonara</i>," and again should bid me come.</p>

<p>If her fairy ears I frighten with the wild words of the West,<br />
Surely love will come to lighten all the burden of my breast.</p>

<p>I will learn her awful lingo, if by any chance I can;<br />
I'll despoil the gay flamingo to provide her with a fan.</p>

<p>She will note my admiration, smiling in a sweet surprise,<br />
And there <i>can</i> be conversation lovers learn 'twist eyes and eyes.</p>

<p>Come what will, methinks I'll chance it, and for pretty things to say,<br />
I will read up, during transit, all <i>The Light of Asia</i>.</p>

<p>Since, Sir <span class="sc">Edwin</span>, dainty dreamer, thine the pen that bids me go,<br />
By the fastest train and steamer, straightway off to Tokio.</p>

<h2>THE LION'S DIARY.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Bother</span> being caged up in this wooden box along with a boar-hound. Why a
boar-hound? Is he supposed to look after me? I rather like that, if he
is. "Look after <i>me</i>?" Why just with one touch of one of my forepaws I
could smash him in half a minute like two-twos. And for the matter of
that, that fellow with the whip, who imagines he keeps me in order, by
fixing his eye on me. Yes, and the horse too; the whole three of them.
But there's that bit of meat at the end of the performance, so I suppose
I may as well appear "to come the docile highly trained beast," and go
through with the tomfoolery and collar it. "Snarl?" <i>Do</i> I? Of course I
do. It's the one outlet I have for my feelings. Who wouldn't snarl under
the circumstances? Fancy, me, the "King of Beasts" (it sounds like
chaff), dropping off a platform, at a given signal, on to the back of an
idiotic circus-horse, stared at through a lot of bars by a house packed
full of applauding fools! And we finish up by a scamper all round
together that seems vastly to amuse them! What a come-down for a Lion!
Learned pigs and educated bears are well enough, but they should know
where to draw the line and stop at the "Monarch." I keep pretty quiet at
present because it pays, but that snarl of mine may end in a roar. By
Jove! if it does, the horse, boar-hound, and fellow with the whip, had
better look out for themselves, and that's all I have got to say about
it at present.</p>

<h2>WINTER AT BURLINGTON HOUSE.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is emphatically pleasant. From a Fine-Art point of view, it is "the
winter of our great content." Only a few weeks ago we had an Exhibition
of the Young Masters, and very-much-alive English Artists&mdash;to wit, the
students of the Royal Academy&mdash;at Burlington House, and now Sir
<span class="sc">Frederick Leighton</span> has waved his wand, and has given us a transformation
scene in the way of a collection of works by the Old Masters and
Deceased Painters of the British School. And a very good show it is, and
very grateful we feel to those who have for a time stripped their rooms
in order that we may enjoy a sight of their treasures. Very restful to
the eye and soothing to the spirit are these grand contributions by the
Old Boys. They may say what they please about the progress of modern
Art, but <i>Mr. Punch</i> is of opinion that many of these fine specimens of
<span class="sc">Crome, Gainsborough, Jansen, Murillo, Mulready</span>, &amp;c., are bad to beat.
How time slips away! It only seems the other day that these Winter
Exhibitions were started by the Royal Academy, and yet the present one
is the twenty-first.</p>

<h2>STATESMEN AT HOME.</h2>

<h3>DCXLI. <span class="sc">Earl Granville, K.G., at Walmer Castle.</span></h3>

</div>
S you step out of the railway carriage that has brought you at
leisurely speed to Deal, you cannot help thinking of another arrival
that, at the time, created even more attention on the part of the
inhabitants. You, bent on a visit to the genial Lord Warden of the
Cinque Ports, arrive from landward.
<span class="sc">Julius C&aelig;sar</span> came by sea; And yet,
so narrow is the world, and so recurrent its movements, you both arrive
at the same town!

<p>As you walk down Beach Street, reading the <i>Commentaries</i>, which you
have brought down in your coat-tail pocket, you recognise the "plain and
open shore" which <span class="sc">C&aelig;sar</span> describes as being reached after passing the
cliffs of Dover.</p>

<p>Here he landed, now many years ago, and your host who, eager for your
coming, even now stands on the top of the great round tower that
dominates his castle-home, can look upon the very spot on which the
Conqueror stepped ashore. Presently he takes you to see the marks of the
intrenchment, plainly visible to this day. With heightened colour and
dramatic gesture the belted Earl tells how, on the fourth night after
the arrival of the Roman fleet, that great storm which ever comes to
Britain's aid in such emergencies, arose, wrecking <span class="sc">J. C&aelig;sar's</span> galleys,
and driving them far up the shingly beach.</p>

<p>"What's to be done now?" <span class="sc">C&aelig;sar's</span> quartermaster asked.</p>

<p>"Done?" said J. <span class="sc">C&aelig;sar</span> in the colloquial Latin of the day. "Why, haul the
fleet up on to the beach."</p>

<p>So they brought the ships ashore; <span class="sc">C&aelig;sar</span> intrenched them within a camp,
and remained there till the weather improved. Your host presses upon
your acceptance a handful of soil from the <i>tumuli</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">C&aelig;sar</span>'s foot may have pressed it," he says, as you, with a perhaps
exaggerated appearance of pleasurable interest, pocket the dust, being
careful to turn your pocket inside out as soon as you are beyond sight
of the castle on your homeward way.</p>

<p>As your hansom pulls up abruptly under the shadow of the ancient castle,
you find your further progress stopped by a <i>fosse</i>, across which is
haughtily flung a sixteenth-century drawbridge. <span class="sc">Henry the Eighth</span>, in a
rare moment of leisure from domestic affairs, built Walmer Castle for
the defence of the coast. You are much struck with the architectural
design, which resembles in some degree a mass of <i>blancmange</i> turned out
of a mould. Four round lunettes of stone, wearily worked by hands now
cold, stand four-square to all the winds that blow. In the middle is a
great round tower, with a cistern on the top, and underneath an arched
cavern which you are pleased to learn is bomb-proof. As you cross the
drawbridge, you feel bound to admit that the prospect is not inviting.
It seems as if you were going to prison instead of to visit, at his
marine residence, one of the most courtly and (peradventure) the most
hospitable noblemen of his age. The severe stonework frowns upon you;
the portholes stare, and you almost wish that, regardless of expense,
you had kept your hansom waiting.</p>

<p>But all uneasiness vanishes as you cross the reverberating stone floor,
and pass into the apartments fronting the sea. You feel as if you had
journeyed into a new world, a sunnier clime. Your host, with
outstretched hand, welcomes you to Walmer, and makes kindly inquiries as
to the incidents of your journey.</p>

<p>"It is, I expect, very cold in London," he says, with his genial smile;
"you will find it Walmer here."</p>

<p>You protest that varieties of temperature are of very inconsiderable
concern to you, and, throwing yourself on the walnut couch by the recess
window, daintily draped with orange-and-blue chintz, you gaze forth on
the varied scene without. The stately ships go on to their haven under
the hill; the ever-changing procession presses on, homeward or outward
bound; and, beyond, the unbroken, treacherous barrier of the Goodwin
Sands.</p>

<p>"It's strange you should choose that place," your host says, in his
soft, liquid tones; "that was the favourite corner of a former
predecessor in the honourable office I now hold. In the first year of
this century, as you know, <span class="sc">William Pitt</span> was Lord Warden of the Cinque
Ports, and, tradition says, used, when he came down here, to sit at that
very window by the hour, gazing across the Downs towards the coast of
France, where his great enemy was preparing for a descent on the British
coast."</p>

<p>Naturally pleased by this coincidence, you endeavour to make your eyes
flash as you look across the sea (you remember to have read somewhere
that <span class="sc">Pitt</span> had "an eagle eye;" perhaps two, but only one is mentioned);
try and think what <span class="sc">Pitt</span> looked like generally, and what he did with his
arms, which you finally decide to fold across your chest, though
conscious that you more resemble <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> crossing the Alps than the
Great Commoner sitting at his drawing-room window in Walmer Castle.</p>

<p>Your host is pardonably proud of his Arboretum, which he has set out on
the roof where, in Tudor times, the cistern flaunted the breeze. Here,
bared to the winter sun, droops the long fronds of the <i>Fucus spungiosus
nodosus</i>. Close by is a specimen of that rare plant the <i>Fucus Dealensis
pedicularis rubrifolio</i>. Here, too, is the <i>Rhamnoides fructifera foliis
satiris</i>, rarely seen so far north. Here, coyly hang the narrow leaves
of the <i>Silene conoidea</i>; and here, slowly rocking in the S.S.W. wind,
is the sand willow (<i>Salix arenaria</i>). You fancy that somewhere you have
seen a finer <i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i>, but the <i>Dianthus cariophyllus</i>,
with its pleasant smell of cloves, well deserved the look of
appreciation which your host bends upon it. Here, too, are the <i>Geranium
maritinum</i>, and the wallflower-scented <i>Hottonia palustris</i> and even the
humble <i>Brassica oleracea</i>.</p>

<p>"I have gathered them all in this district myself," your host says,
opening the violet velvet smoking-jacket (for which he has exchanged the
warlike garb he usually wears at Walmer) and casually displaying the
belt that marks his earldom.</p>

<p>You would like to ask whether a belted Earl ever wears braces, but
whilst you are thinking of how so delicate a question may be framed,
<span class="sc">Granville</span>, <span class="sc">George</span>, <span class="sc">Leveson-Gower</span>, Earl <span class="sc">Granville</span>, Knight of the Garter
and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, relates, with that never failing
flow of natural humour which so greatly endears him to Lord <span class="sc">Salisbury</span>,
the story of his chequered career, since he left Christchurch, Oxford,
now more than half a century ago and became Attach&eacute; to the Embassy at
Paris. The narrative which is full of point, agreeably occupies the time
up to half-past one, when the beating of a huge drum announces luncheon.
You make a feint of at once leaving, and Lord <span class="sc">Granville</span>, with that
almost excessive politeness which distinguishes him, hesitates to oppose
your apparent inclination.</p>

<p>As you pass out, skirting the piece of old ordnance dragged from the sea
in 1775, near the Goodwin Sands, by some fishermen who were sweeping for
anchors in the Gull-stream, you reach the conclusion, that politeness
may sometimes be carried too far. "Deale," notes <span class="sc">Leland</span>, in his
interesting <i>Itinerary</i>, "is half a myle fro the shore of the sea, a
Finssheher village iii myles or more above Sandwich." That is all very
well for Deal; but a gentleman of healthy habits, who left London at ten
o'clock this morning would, as the afternoon advances, certainly not be
so much as three miles above a sandwich if it were offered.</p>

<p>Pleased with this quaint conceit, in which there is peradventure some
little humour, you drop in at a confectioner's, and fortify yourself
with a nineteenth-century bun, with which you trifle whilst the train
tarries.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">A Sporting Correspondent</span>, who says "he isn't in the know," asks "what we
think of <i>Garter</i> for the Derby?" A word to the wise is sufficient.
"Garter" rhymes to "Starter." The Motto of the Garter is, <i>Honi soit qui
mal y pense</i>. We have spoken.</p>

<h2>PUZZLES FOR THE NEW YEAR.</h2>

<p><i>The Emperor of Germany.</i>&mdash;To make a couple of public speeches without
making use ten times of the first personal pronoun.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stanley.</i>&mdash;To escape an overwhelming and universal ovation on his
return.</p>

<p><i>The Czar.</i>&mdash;To increase the Naval and Military Estimates of his country
with one hand, and at the same time succeed in controlling so-called
"legitimate National aspirations" with the other.</p>

<p><i>The Sultan.</i>&mdash;To pay his way, and yet preserve a smiling countenance.</p>

<p><i>The Gas-Stokers' Union.</i>&mdash;To learn the lesson taught them by the course
of recent events, and grow wise in time, without making further
mischievous efforts to alienate public sympathy.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barnum</i>.&mdash;To prove to the grumblers, who write to the Papers to
complain of the "Booking" arrangements in connection with "The Greatest
Show on Earth," that the management is perfect, and could not be better.</p>

<p><i>The Emperor of Brazil.</i>&mdash;To make ends meet on an income of nothing
a-year.</p>

<p><i>The Covent Garden Lion.</i>&mdash;To find that his quite sedate, leisurely, and
altogether proper performance is watched every night in breathless
suspense by an excited audience.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Augustus Harris</i>.&mdash;To think already how he can manage to make his
next year's Christmas Pantomime outdo even his,&mdash;this season's,&mdash;latest
triumphant effort.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Gladstone.</i>&mdash;How to fit the items of his new Radical programme
nicely in with his Home-Rule Scheme, with a view to making some sort of
stir with both in the approaching Parliamentary Session.</p>

<p><i>The Recently Unrolled Mummy</i>.&mdash;To discover how he came to be so long
neglected in a back room in Gower Street, and to find out, now that they
have pounced on him, who the dickens he was when "up and doing" in Old
Egypt thirty centuries back.</p>

<p><i>The Authorities at the War Office</i>.&mdash;How to satisfy an inquisitive
public that 18,000 troopers can be comfortably and efficiently mounted
on the 12,000 horses, the total number provided for them for that
purpose by those who are responsible for their supply.</p>

<p><i>The London Omnibus Horse.</i>&mdash;How to get supplied with a proper shoe,
that will enable him to keep on his legs with equal facility on granite,
Macadam, wood, or asphalte.</p>

<p><i>The First Lord of the Admiralty.</i>&mdash;How to satisfy the country, from his
place in Parliament, that the "Department" is turning out big guns in
any number, and that, when they are turned out, he'll pledge his word
that they won't burst&mdash;unreasonably.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"<span class="sc">Killaloe Dam Gone.</span>"&mdash;Under this heading, boldly displayed, the
<i>Scottish Leader</i> announces that the inundation of the Shannon has
caused further serious damage to the new drainage works at Killaloe. The
way of putting it is undoubtedly terse and emphatic. It sets forth in
three words the consternation that fell upon Killaloe when the Shannon
rose, and the ruthless ruin that whelmed the town when the waters
retired. At the same time it is not quite the language we would have
expected from an able and responsible journal which has bearded the
<i>Scotsman</i> in its den, and shown that, after all, it is possible to
establish a prosperous Liberal newspaper in the Lowlands.</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH'S MORAL MUSIC-HALL DRAMAS.</h2>

<h3>THE MAN-TRAP.</h3>
</div>

<p>This Drama, which, like our last, has been suggested by a poem of the
Misses <span class="sc">Taylors'</span>, will be found most striking and impressive in
representation upon the Music-hall stage. The dramatist has ventured to
depart somewhat from the letter, though not the spirit, of the original
text, in his desire to enforce the moral to the fullest possible extent.
Our present piece is intended to teach the great lesson that an
inevitable Nemesis attends apple-stealing in this world, and that Doom
cannot be disarmed by the intercession of the evil-doer's friends,
however well-meaning.</p>
